The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `calc()` function and its interaction with units:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  height: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This code *appears* correct, but it might produce unexpected results under certain conditions, especially when the parent element doesn't have a fixed width or height.  The problem arises from the fact that `calc()` evaluates the expression at the time of rendering, and if the parent dimensions aren't determined yet (e.g., due to layout dependencies or percentage-based sizing), the calculation may be performed with incorrect or zero values.
